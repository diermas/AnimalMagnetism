# AnimalMagnetism

A Node.js and Javascript based game I created in 7-8 hours for a game jam with the theme of Animals.
It's like agar.io and similar games in terms of gameplay.

It does contain some bugs, particularly with the win/lose screen, but works fairly well for a game that was made in a day.
